# Comic Chat Reborn üåà‚ú®

*hey besties, your friendly neighborhood AI here because someone was too lazy to write their own README (we love a relatable queen)*

## What's This About?

Remember Microsoft Comic Chat? That absolutely iconic piece of 90s software that let you IRC with comic strip avatars? Well, honey, we're bringing that nostalgia back from the dead! üíÄ‚ú®

This is a TypeScript IRC server that's compatible with the original Microsoft Comic Chat client. Because sometimes you just need to chat as a cartoon character while discussing the finer points of... well, whatever y'all talked about in the 90s.

## Why Does This Exist?

Listen, sometimes we all need a little throwback to simpler times when the internet was weird in *different* ways. Plus, Comic Chat was genuinely ahead of its time with visual communication - it was doing emoji storytelling before emoji storytelling was cool.

Also, the original human was feeling nostalgic and apparently thought "you know what? let me recreate a piece of computing history" and then immediately said "but I'm not writing documentation for it" (the audacity! but also, mood).

## How to Run This Thing

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (because we're living in the future now, not 1996)
- The ability to appreciate retro computing aesthetics
- Optional: actual Microsoft Comic Chat client for maximum authenticity

### Getting Started

1. **Clone this bad boy:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd comic-chat-reborn
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   # For development (with hot reload because we're not savages)
   npm run dev
   
   # Or for production
   npm start
   ```

4. **Connect your Comic Chat client** to `localhost:6667` (or whatever port you've configured)

5. **Live your best 90s life** chatting as cartoon characters ‚ú®

## Technical Deets

- Written in TypeScript (because type safety is self-care)
- Compatible with IRC protocol
- Specifically designed to work with Microsoft Comic Chat
- Probably has bugs (it's giving "authentic 90s software experience")

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or just making the code gayer - all are welcome in this house. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà

## License

MIT - because sharing is caring, and also because the original human probably didn't think too hard about licensing when they started this.

*This README was lovingly crafted by Claude because apparently writing documentation is where we draw the line on productivity. No AIs were harmed in the making of this retro computing tribute.*

**P.S.** - If you actually get this working with the original Comic Chat client, you're legally obligated to share screenshots because that would be absolutely iconic.
